# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived notebooks and documentation from previous development phases.

## Purpose

The archive preserves historical development work, completed implementations, and superseded approaches for reference and learning.

## Structure

### completed-week-summaries/
Contains completion summaries from major development phases:
- **WEEK2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Week 2 development completion
- **WEEK3_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETION.md** - Week 3 consolidation phase
- **WEEK3_PERSISTENT_LEARNING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Persistent learning implementation
- **WEEK3_PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 1 completion summary
- **WEEK4_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Week 4 advanced features completion

### historical-analysis/
Contains analysis and findings from development phases:
- **BENCHMARK_FINDINGS_PHASE13.md** - Phase 13 benchmark analysis
- **ENHANCED_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Feature roadmap documentation
- **NOTEBOOK_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - Historical notebook cleanup summary

### superseded-plans/
Contains outdated or replaced implementation plans:
- **THERMALEQUILIBRIUM_MODEL_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - Superseded migration plan
- **TODO_THERMAL_EQUILIBRIUM_ENHANCEMENT.md** - Replaced enhancement plan
- **WEEK4_ADVANCED_CONTROL_LOGIC_PLAN.md** - Superseded control logic plan

## Archive Policy

### What Gets Archived
- ✅ Completed development phase summaries
- ✅ Superseded implementation plans
- ✅ Outdated approach documentation
- ✅ Historical analysis and findings
- ✅ Deprecated notebook implementations

### What Stays Active
- ❌ Current development notebooks (`/notebooks/development/`)
- ❌ Active monitoring dashboards (`/notebooks/monitoring/`)
- ❌ Current implementation plans
- ❌ Active configuration and code

## Usage

### Research and Reference
1. **Learning from History**: Review previous approaches and decisions
2. **Implementation Context**: Understand evolution of features
3. **Benchmarking**: Compare current vs historical performance
4. **Documentation**: Access detailed development summaries

### Archive Maintenance
- Archive completed development phases
- Move superseded plans when new approaches are adopted
- Preserve analysis and findings for future reference
- Maintain clear organization by development phase

## Key Historical Milestones

### Phase 0-1 (Foundation)
- Basic thermal model implementation
