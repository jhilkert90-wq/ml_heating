```

## Dashboard Access

Once running, access the dashboard through:
- **Home Assistant Sidebar** - "ML Heating Control" panel
- **Direct URL** - `http://homeassistant:3001`

### Dashboard Features
- **Overview** - Real-time system status and performance
- **Control** - Start/stop, mode switching, manual controls  
- **Performance** - Live MAE/RMSE, confidence tracking
- **Analysis** - Feature importance and learning progress
- **Configuration** - Live settings management

## Development Access

For advanced users wanting to analyze the system with Jupyter notebooks:

```python
# Install in your notebook environment
pip install requests pandas numpy

# Connect to add-on
from notebooks.addon_client import AddonDevelopmentClient
addon = AddonDevelopmentClient("http://homeassistant:3003", "your-dev-key")

# Download live model and data
live_model = addon.download_live_model()
live_state = addon.get_live_state()
recent_logs = addon.get_recent_logs()
```

## Operation

### Getting Started
1. **Start in Shadow Mode** (recommended)
   - System observes your current heat curve
   - Learns house characteristics safely
   - Provides performance comparison

2. **Monitor Learning Progress**
   - Check dashboard for confidence levels
   - Review learning metrics and milestones
   - Analyze feature importance

3. **Switch to Active Mode**
   - When confidence > 0.9 and MAE < 0.2°C
   - ML takes control of heating
   - Continue monitoring performance

### Performance Expectations

**Learning Milestones:**
- **Cycles 0-200**: Basic learning, confidence building
- **Cycles 200-1000**: Advanced features activate
- **Cycles 1000+**: Mature operation with seasonal adaptation

**Typical Performance:**
- **MAE**: < 0.2°C (excellent), < 0.3°C (good)
- **Confidence**: > 0.9 (optimal), > 0.7 (acceptable)  
- **Energy Savings**: 10-25% vs static heat curves
- **Temperature Stability**: 50-70% variance reduction

## Safety

### Multiple Protection Layers
1. **Absolute temperature limits** (14-65°C configurable)
2. **Rate limiting** (max 2°C change per 30-min cycle)
3. **Blocking detection** (DHW, defrost, disinfection)
4. **Grace periods** (intelligent recovery after blocking)
5. **Physics validation** (thermodynamic compliance)

### Monitoring
- **ML State Sensor** - Real-time system status
- **Error Detection** - Network, sensor, and model errors
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed operation history
- **Alert Integration** - Home Assistant notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Add-on won't start:**
- Check entity IDs are correct
- Verify InfluxDB connectivity (if used)
- Review add-on logs for configuration errors

**Low confidence/high errors:**
- Ensure stable sensor readings
- Check for missing historical data
- Verify heating system is responsive

**Dashboard not accessible:**
- Confirm port 3001 is not blocked
- Check Home Assistant network configuration
- Review dashboard logs for errors

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs** - Add-on logs show detailed operation
2. **Review configuration** - Validate all entity IDs
3. **Monitor sensors** - Ensure stable, accurate readings
4. **Use shadow mode** - Safe testing and comparison

## Migration from Standalone

If you're currently using the standalone systemd version:

1. **Stop systemd service**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop ml_heating
   sudo systemctl disable ml_heating
   ```

2. **Backup your model**
   ```bash
   cp /opt/ml_heating/ml_model.pkl /backup/location/
   ```

3. **Install add-on** and configure entities

4. **Import existing model**
   - Enable "import_existing_model" in add-on config
   - Set "existing_model_path" to your backup location
   - Restart add-on

Your learning progress will be preserved!
