# ML Heating Control for Home Assistant

> **Warning**
> This project is an initial test and proof of concept heating controller. However, heating systems are critical infrastructure - always monitor its behavior and ensure you have safety mechanisms in place. Use at your own risk.

This project implements a **physics-based machine learning heating control system** that integrates with Home Assistant. It uses a ThermalEquilibriumModel to predict the optimal water outlet temperature for a heat pump, continuously learning from real-world results to efficiently maintain your target indoor temperature.

## Overview

Traditional heating curves are static: they map outdoor temperature to a fixed outlet temperature. This system is **dynamic and adaptive** - it learns your house's unique thermal characteristics and continuously improves its predictions based on what actually happens.

## Goal

The primary goal is to improve upon traditional heat curves by creating a **self-learning system** that:

-   **Increases Efficiency:** Minimizes energy waste by precisely matching heating output to actual need
-   **Improves Comfort:** Maintains stable indoor temperature with less overshoot/undershoot
-   **Adapts Continuously:** Learns from every cycle, adjusting to seasons, weather patterns, house changes, and occupancy
-   **Anticipates Conditions:** Uses weather and PV forecasts to proactively adjust heating
-   **Operates Safely:** Includes comprehensive blocking logic, gradual temperature changes, and health monitoring

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities

-   **Physics-Based Machine Learning:** Uses ThermalEquilibriumModel that understands thermodynamic principles while learning your house's unique characteristics from real data
-   **Online Learning:** Continuously adapts after every heating cycle - learns from what actually happened vs what was predicted
-   **Live Performance Tracking:** Real-time confidence and accuracy monitoring that adapts to actual prediction performance
-   **Delta Forecast Calibration:** Advanced forecasting integration with weather and PV power predictions
-   **Seasonal Adaptation:** Automatic parameter adjustment learns seasonal variations without manual recalibration
-   **Active & Shadow Modes:** Can run in active mode (controlling heating) or shadow mode (calculating but not applying, for safe testing and comparison)
-   **Home Assistant Integration:** Seamless bi-directional integration - reads sensors, writes control temperatures, publishes metrics and diagnostics
-   **InfluxDB Historical Data:** Leverages your existing Home Assistant/InfluxDB setup for initial calibration and historical feature engineering

### Intelligent Control

-   **Enhanced Model Wrapper:** Intelligent prediction system that replaces complex control logic with simplified outlet temperature prediction
-   **Gentle Trajectory Correction:** Intelligent additive correction system that prevents outlet temperature spikes during thermal trajectory deviations, using proven heat curve automation logic (5°C/8°C/12°C per degree) instead of aggressive multiplicative factors
-   **Smart Rounding:** Tests both floor and ceiling temperatures, predicts outcomes, chooses the one that gets closest to target
-   **Gradual Temperature Control:** Limits maximum temperature change per cycle to protect heat pump from abrupt setpoint jumps
-   **Differential-Based Effectiveness:** Heat transfer effectiveness scales with outlet-indoor temperature differential for accurate low-differential scenarios
-   **Adaptive Learning:** Model parameters continuously adjust based on prediction feedback to improve accuracy over time
-   **Open Window Adaptation:** System automatically detects sudden heat loss changes (like opened windows) and applies gentle corrections, then restabilizes when disturbances end

### Safety & Robustness

-   **Blocking Event Handling:** Automatically pauses and waits during DHW heating, defrosting, disinfection, and DHW boost heater operation
-   **Grace Period after Blocking:** After blocking events end, intelligently waits for outlet temperature to stabilize before resuming ML control:
    
    - **After DHW heating** (outlet hotter): Sets aggressive cool-down target and waits for outlet to cool
    - **After defrost** (outlet colder): Restores exact pre-defrost target and waits for outlet to fully recover
    
    - Intelligently determines whether to wait for cooling or warming based on measured outlet vs target
    - Enforces maximum timeout to prevent indefinite stalling
    - Prevents inefficient temperature oscillations and protects model learning quality

-   **Heating Status Check:** Skips prediction and learning when heating system is not in 'heat' or 'auto' mode
-   **Absolute Temperature Clamping:** Enforces safe minimum/maximum outlet temperatures
-   **Confidence Monitoring:** Tracks model confidence and publishes it to Home Assistant for monitoring and automation

### External Heat Sources

-   **Fireplace Mode:** When fireplace is active, uses alternative temperature sensor (e.g., average of other rooms) to prevent incorrect learning
-   **PV Solar Warming:** Learns how solar power generation affects indoor temperature
-   **TV/Electronics Heat:** Can track heat contribution from electronics and appliances

### Live Performance Tracking

-   **Real-time Confidence Calculation:** Dynamic confidence based on rolling window of recent prediction accuracy
-   **Adaptive Uncertainty Bounds:** Automatically adjusts based on actual performance
-   **Live Learning Updates:** Model parameters continuously adjust based on prediction feedback
-   **Prediction Error Attribution:** Tracks actual vs predicted temperature changes for transparent performance monitoring
-   **Dynamic Performance Diagnostics:** ML state sensor includes real-time confidence that reflects current accuracy

### Monitoring & Diagnostics

-   **ML State Sensor:** Comprehensive sensor (`sensor.ml_heating_state`) with numeric state codes and detailed attributes for monitoring system health
-   **Performance Metrics:** Real-time confidence tracking that updates every cycle
-   **Shadow Mode Metrics:** When in shadow mode, tracks separate metrics for ML vs heat curve performance comparison
-   **Learning Metrics Export:** Exports learning parameters to InfluxDB every cycle for detailed analysis
-   **Learning Dashboard:** Interactive Jupyter notebook for at-a-glance learning status
-   **Detailed Logging:** Comprehensive logging of decisions, predictions, and learning progress

### Deployment

### The Thermal Model

The controller uses **ThermalEquilibriumModel** - a physics-based machine learning approach that combines thermodynamic principles with data-driven learning:

**Core Physics Parameters (learned from data):**
- Thermal time constant: How quickly the house responds to heating changes
- Heat loss coefficient: Rate of heat loss to outdoor environment
- Outlet effectiveness: Efficiency of heat transfer from outlet to indoor air

**External Heat Sources (automatically calibrated):**
- PV solar warming: Heat gain from solar power generation
- Fireplace heating rate: Contribution from secondary heat sources
- TV/electronics heat: Heat from appliances and devices

**Enhanced Learning Features:**
- Adaptive learning: Parameters adjust based on prediction accuracy
- Differential-based effectiveness: Heat transfer scales with outlet-indoor temperature differential
- Weather forecast integration: Anticipates temperature changes
- PV forecast integration: Predicts solar heat gain

**System States & Blocking:**
- DHW heating, defrosting, disinfection, DHW boost heater
- Automatically detected and handled with appropriate wait periods

### Model Calibration & Learning

**Initial Calibration (Recommended):**
```bash
python3 -m src.main --calibrate-physics
```
- Trains model on historical data from InfluxDB
- Duration: `TRAINING_LOOKBACK_HOURS` (default: 168 hours / 7 days)
- Learns your house's unique thermal characteristics
- Calibrates external heat source effects

**Continuous Online Learning:**
After calibration, the model learns from every heating cycle:
1. Sets outlet temperature based on current prediction
2. Waits one cycle (`CYCLE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`)
3. Measures actual indoor temperature change
4. Reads what temperature was actually applied (supports shadow mode)
5. Updates model parameters based on prediction accuracy
6. Improves future predictions

This happens automatically in both **active mode** (ML controls heating) and **shadow mode** (heat curve controls, ML learns).

### Active vs Shadow Mode

The system supports two operating modes:

**Active Mode:**
- ML directly controls heating by writing to `TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID`
- Model learns from its own decisions
- Configuration: Set both entity IDs to the same value

**Shadow Mode:**
- Heat curve controls heating (writes to one entity)
- ML calculates but doesn't apply (writes to different entity)
- Model learns from heat curve's decisions
- Use shadow mode to:
  - Safely test ML before going active
  - Compare performance quantitatively
  - Continue learning while heat curve controls
  - Decide when ML is ready to take over

**Switching Modes:**
Simply change entity IDs in `.env` and restart:
```bash
# Shadow mode (different entities)
TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur
ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.hp_target_temp_circuit1

# Active mode (same entity)
TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur
ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur
```

Switch to active mode when you're confident in ML performance through shadow mode observation.

### ML State Sensor

The system publishes `sensor.ml_heating_state` with numeric state codes and rich diagnostic attributes:

**State Codes:**
| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 0 | OK | Prediction completed successfully |
| 1 | LOW_CONFIDENCE | Model confidence below threshold - logged for monitoring |
| 2 | BLOCKED | Blocking activity active (DHW/defrost/etc) - cycle skipped |
| 3 | NETWORK_ERROR | Failed to communicate with Home Assistant |
| 4 | NO_DATA | Missing critical sensors or insufficient history |
| 5 | TRAINING | Running initial calibration |
| 6 | HEATING_OFF | Heating not in 'heat' or 'auto' mode - cycle skipped |
| 7 | MODEL_ERROR | Exception during prediction or learning |

**Key Attributes:**
- `state_description`: Human-readable status
- `confidence`: Model confidence metrics
- `suggested_temp`, `final_temp`, `predicted_indoor`: Latest values
- `blocking_reasons`: List of active blocking events
- `missing_sensors`: List of unavailable critical sensors
- `last_prediction_time`, `last_updated`: Timestamps
- `last_error`: Error message for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**State Code 3: Network Error**
- Check Home Assistant is running and accessible
- Verify `HASS_URL` and `HASS_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Check network connectivity

**State Code 4: No Data**
- Check all required entity IDs exist in Home Assistant
- Look at `missing_sensors` attribute on `sensor.ml_heating_state`
- Verify entity IDs match exactly (case-sensitive)

**State Code 6: Heating Off**
- Heating system not in 'heat' or 'auto' mode
- Check your climate entity
- Normal during summer or when heating manually disabled

**State Code 7: Model Error**
- Check `last_error` attribute for details
- May indicate corrupted model file
- Try recalibrating: `--calibrate-physics`
- Check logs for Python exceptions

**Poor Performance**
- Recalibrate model with recent data
- Increase `CYCLE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` for better learning signal
- Check if blocking events are properly detected
- Verify all external heat sources configured correctly

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging:
```bash
# Temporarily for testing
python3 -m src.main --debug

# Or in service, edit /etc/systemd/system/ml_heating.service
# Add to [Service] section:
Environment="DEBUG=1"
```

### Emergency: Revert to Heat Curve

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Stop ML heating
sudo systemctl stop ml_heating.service

# Re-enable your original heat curve automation in Home Assistant

# Or, quickly switch to shadow mode in .env:
ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.hp_target_temp_circuit1
sudo systemctl restart ml_heating.service
```

The model continues learning in shadow mode, so you can analyze what went wrong and switch back when ready.
