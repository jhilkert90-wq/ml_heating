## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Gentle Trajectory Correction System**: Intelligent additive correction preventing outlet temperature spikes during thermal trajectory deviations
- **Enhanced Forecast Integration**: Fixed feature storage during binary search for accurate trajectory verification with real PV/temperature forecast data
- **Open Window Adaptation**: System automatically detects sudden heat loss changes and restabilizes when disturbances end
- **Comprehensive TDD Test Suite**: 11 tests for differential scaling removal with 100% pass rate
- Thermal state validator for robust physics parameter validation
- Comprehensive thermal physics test suite with 36 critical tests
- Smart temperature rounding using thermal model predictions
- Enhanced logging to show actual applied temperatures

### Changed
- **MAJOR: Trajectory Correction Algorithm**: Replaced aggressive multiplicative correction (7x factors causing outlet spikes) with gentle additive approach based on user's heat curve automation (5°C/8°C/12°C per degree)
- **MAJOR: Thermal Model Simplification**: Removed differential-based effectiveness scaling to eliminate calibration-runtime mismatch and ensure consistent model behavior
- **Correction Boundaries**: Conservative ≤0.5°C/≤1.0°C/>1.0°C thresholds instead of aggressive ≤0.3°C/>0.5°C thresholds
- **Heat Curve Alignment**: Trajectory corrections now use proven 15°C per degree shift logic, scaled for direct outlet temperature adjustment
- Simplified heat balance equation to use constant outlet effectiveness coefficient
- Enhanced test coverage for thermal physics edge cases and validation
- Updated logging format to show rounded temperatures applied to HA sensors

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Aggressive Trajectory Correction** - Eliminated outlet temperature doubling (0.5°C error → 65°C outlet) by replacing multiplicative with gentle additive corrections (0.5°C error → +2.5°C adjustment)
- **Feature Storage During Binary Search** - Fixed missing forecast data access during trajectory verification phases
- **CRITICAL: Thermal Physics Model Bug** - Fixed fundamental physics implementation error causing physically impossible temperature predictions (heating systems predicting cooling)
- Binary search convergence issues - system now finds optimal outlet temperatures correctly
- Energy conservation violations in thermal equilibrium calculations
- Cosmetic logging issue showing unrounded vs applied temperature values
- Test suite failures for outdoor coupling and thermal physics validation
- Heat input calculations using corrected physics formula: T_eq = (eff × outlet + loss × outdoor + external) / (eff + loss)

### Technical Achievements
- **Overnight Stability Enhanced**: Gentle trajectory corrections prevent system over-reaction during PV shutdown and weather changes
- **Conservative Control**: 0.5°C trajectory error now produces reasonable +2.5°C outlet adjustment instead of temperature doubling
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Trajectory verification uses actual changing forecasts instead of static assumptions
- **User-Aligned Logic**: Trajectory corrections based on proven heat curve automation patterns already in successful use
- **Production Ready**: All 36 critical thermal model tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Physics Compliance**: System now respects thermodynamics and energy conservation
- **Accuracy**: Temperature predictions now physically realistic and mathematically correct
- **Reliability**: Binary search convergence eliminates maximum temperature requests
- **Energy Efficiency**: Heat pump operates optimally instead of maximum unnecessarily
